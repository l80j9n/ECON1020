Country Report Instruction (total number of pages: 10)
CONTEXT 
A   multinational company is considering   investing   in the country that you   have   been   allocated.   If the   macroeconomic environment of the country is deemed favourable   compared to   alternative destinations, then the company will   proceed to look for specific   investment   projects.   However, you   are   not   provided with any   information   regarding   potential   investment   projects for commercial confidentiality reasons.
YOUR TASKS 
As   independent an economic consultant, you are hired   by this   company to:
a)      provide an economic profile for the   country;   and
b)      benchmark   its performance against Australia, which   is the destination recommended   by   another independent consultant.
In doing so, you will deliver a structured Country Report, which   includes the following   illustrative   features:
巴      Up to three (3) figures (diagrams, graphs or tables)   in   total.   Here,   you   can   use   a   mixture   of diagrams, graphs and tables   provided the total number is   no   more than   3. 
巴      You can   include more than one variable   in   a   graph   or table. 
巴      You   must   produce your figures, rather than cut and   paste from some sources. You   must keep a copy of the file that you use to   create your figures   as   you   could   be   asked   to   provide   it   as proof that those figures are your work. 
巴      You can   use direct quotes   provided the total   number of quoted words sums   to   20 words   or less   in the whole of the report. This rule   is   intended to   prevent students   from   over-relying   on   direct quotes without critically analysing the content of the source.
